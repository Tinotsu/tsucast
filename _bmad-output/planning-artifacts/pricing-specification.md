# tsucast Pricing Specification v1.2

**Created:** 2026-01-24
**Status:** Approved

## Executive Summary

tsucast uses an **article credit** pricing model with no subscription. Users buy credit packs and spend credits to convert articles to audio. Short articles bank leftover time, long articles use multiple credits.

---

## Core Model: Article Credits

```
1 CREDIT = 1 ARTICLE (up to 20 min of audio)

• Most articles (5-20 min) = 1 credit
• Long articles (20+ min) = 2+ credits
• Short articles = 1 credit, leftover time banks for later
• Minimum charge: 3 minutes per article
```

### Credit Calculation

| Article Length | Credits Used | Time Banked |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| 5 min | 1 credit | 15 min |
| 12 min | 1 credit | 8 min |
| 18 min | 1 credit | 2 min |
| 20 min | 1 credit | 0 min |
| 25 min | Uses banked time first | Varies |
| 35 min | 2 credits | 5 min |
| 55 min | 3 credits | 5 min |

### Time Bank System

Users accumulate "banked time" from short articles that offsets longer articles:

```
Time bank starts at 0

For each article:
  1. Check duration
  2. Add banked time to available
  3. Calculate credits needed: ceil((duration - banked) / 20)
  4. If credits needed ≤ 0 → use banked time only (0 credits)
  5. Update bank: bank = (credits × 20) - duration + old_bank
```

## Smart Caching Rule

```

### Words to Audio Conversion

```
Audio duration ≈ Word count ÷ 150

2,500 words →  16-17 min
5,000 words →  33 min
10,000 words → 67 min

## Implementation Notes

### Database Schema

```sql
-- User credits balance
credits_balance: integer (total minutes available)
credits_purchased: integer (lifetime credits bought)
credits_used: integer (lifetime credits spent)

-- Time bank (for short article rollover)
time_bank_minutes: integer (accumulated from short articles)
```

### Credit Deduction Logic

```typescript
function calculateCreditsNeeded(durationMinutes: number, timeBank: number): {
  creditsNeeded: number;
  newTimeBank: number;
} {
  const MIN_CHARGE = 3;
  const CREDIT_SIZE = 20;

  // Apply minimum
  const effectiveDuration = Math.max(durationMinutes, MIN_CHARGE);

  // Use time bank first
  const netDuration = effectiveDuration - timeBank;

  if (netDuration <= 0) {
    // Covered by time bank
    return { creditsNeeded: 0, newTimeBank: timeBank - effectiveDuration };
  }

  // Calculate credits needed
  const creditsNeeded = Math.ceil(netDuration / CREDIT_SIZE);
  const timeProvided = creditsNeeded * CREDIT_SIZE;
  const newTimeBank = timeProvided - netDuration;

  return { creditsNeeded, newTimeBank };
}
```
