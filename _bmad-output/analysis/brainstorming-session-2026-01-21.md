# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Tino
**Date:** 2026-01-21

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Virality and Network Effects for tsucast
**Goals:** Viral loops, network effects, growth mechanics - while maintaining simplicity

### Context Guidance

_Building on previous session insights: tsucast is a "paste URL, get audio" app with Tom Bombadil energy - joyful, magical, simple. The viral demo moment identified was "Bro I have Tolkien reading me LOTR." Core constraint: simplicity is THE feature (3.5 screens max)._

### Session Setup

- **Focus Area:** Growth mechanics that don't compromise simplicity
- **Success Criteria:** Identify viral loops and network effects that feel native to the product
- **Approach:** Learn from successful apps in audio/podcast/content domain
- **Key Constraint:** Any viral feature must feel like magic, not marketing

---

## Technique 1: Cross-Pollination

### Viral Hall of Fame - Studied Apps

| App | Viral Mechanic | Key Insight |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| Spotify Wrapped | Annual shareable cards | Identity expression |
| Duolingo | Streaks + social pressure | Commitment loops |
| TikTok | Watermarked clips | Content IS the ad |
| Wordle | Emoji grid sharing | Spoiler-free social proof |
| Audible | "Send this book" free | Gift mechanic |
| Strava | Activity feed + monthly summaries | Public performance |

### Ideas Extracted

| Category | Ideas |
|----------|-------|
| **Gift Mechanics** | Send at creation, friend listens free, "made this for you" |
| **Identity/Profile** | Listener archetypes (Big Five style), evolving profile, compare with friends |
| **Social Proof** | Niche pride badges, discovery rarity scores ("Only 23 people listened") |
| **Network Value** | Voice ratings (community curates), pre-generated popular content |

### Key Insight: Niche Pride > Mass Appeal

- "You're one of 23 people who listened to this" > "10K people read this"
- Intellectual identity = discovering hidden gems, not following trends

---

## Technique 2: First Principles Thinking

### Why People Share (The Real Reasons)

| Surface Reason | First Principle Truth |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "To help others" | To **signal who I am** (helper identity) |
| "It's useful" | To **strengthen relationships** (I thought of you) |
| "It's cool" | To **feel part of something** (shared experience) |
| "FOMO" | To **be the source** (I found this first) |

### The 10/10 Test

Every viral feature must pass:

1. **Does the SHARER look good?** (identity)
2. **Does the RECEIVER get immediate value?** (no signup wall)
3. **Is it 2 taps or less?** (friction)
4. **Does it feel like a gift, not a referral?** (relationship)

### Features Designed for 10/10

#### 1. "Made for You" (Send at Creation)
- Sharer: Curator/gift-giver identity
- Receiver: Audio plays INSTANTLY in browser, no signup
- Friction: 2 taps inline after generate
- Framing: "Tino made this for you" - zero app mention in share text

#### 2. Listener Profile Share
- Sharer: Flattering archetypes only ("The Polymath", "The Deep Diver")
- Receiver: "Discover YOUR type" with 3 free generations
- Friction: Profile → Share → done
- Framing: About sharer's identity, curiosity-driven

#### 3. Niche Pride Badge
- Sharer: "I discovered this before it was cool" energy
- Receiver: The badge IS a recommendation + instant listen
- Friction: After rare listen → "Share your discovery?" → done
- Framing: Sharing the CONTENT, not the app

#### 4. Monthly Wrapped
- Sharer: Intellectual flex ("I spent my commute learning")
- Receiver: Includes ONE gift listen ("My favorite this month")
- Friction: End of month → Share → done
- Framing: Insight is interesting alone, gift is bonus

### The 10/10 Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Flattery by design | Every label makes sharer look good |
| Instant value, zero walls | Receiver plays in browser, no signup |
| Content-first, app-invisible | Share the article, not the tool |
| Gift embedded | Every share includes free listen |
| 2-tap max | Share action IN the natural flow |

## Technique 3: Morphological Analysis

### Parameter Matrix

| Dimension | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| **Trigger** | Creation, After listen, End of month, Achievement, Friend joins |
| **Format** | Audio link, Visual card, Profile, Collection, Badge |
| **Hook** | Instant play, Discover type, Recommendation, Challenge, Exclusive |
| **Network** | Better voices, Social proof, Friend graph, Crowdsourced, Pre-generated |

### Winning Combinations

| Feature | Trigger | Format | Hook | Network Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|------|----------------|
| "Made for You" | Creation | Audio link | Instant play | Curation |
| "Monthly Wrapped" | End of month | Visual card | Instant play | Social proof |
| "Rare Find" | After listen | Badge | Recommendation | Social proof |
| "Listener Profile" | Achievement | Profile | Discover type | Friend graph |
| "This Reminded Me" | After listen | Visual card | Recommendation | Curation |

### Priority Matrix

| Feature | Viral Potential | Effort | Priority |
|---------|-----------------|--------|----------|
| "Made for You" | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Low | **MVP** |
| "Rare Find" badge | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Low | **MVP** |
| "This Reminded Me" | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Low | **MVP** |
| Monthly Wrapped | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium | Post-MVP |
| Listener Profile | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium | Post-MVP |
| Hot Right Now | ⭐⭐⭐ | Medium | Later |
| Profile Match | ⭐⭐⭐ | High | Later |

## Session Summary

### The MVP Viral Stack

| # | Feature | Why It Works |
|---|---------|--------------|
| 1 | **"Made for You"** | Gift at creation = highest intent moment |
| 2 | **"Rare Find" badge** | Niche pride = intellectual identity signal |
| 3 | **"This Reminded Me"** | After-listen share = relationship builder |

All three: low effort, high viral potential, pass 10/10 test, no extra screens.

### Network Effects Summary

| Effect | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Voice ratings** | More users = better voice curation = better experience for new users |
| **Social proof** | Niche listen counts drive discovery pride |
| **Pre-generated popular** | Hot content = instant play = free tier hook |

### The Fundamental Truths

1. **Sharing is identity construction** - Make sharers look intellectual, curious, generous
2. **Receiver value must be instant** - Play in browser, no signup, no friction
3. **Content-first, app-invisible** - Share the article, not "check out this app"
4. **Gift > referral** - "I made this for you" beats "join my app"
5. **Niche pride > mass appeal** - "Only 23 people heard this" is the flex

### Post-MVP Roadmap

| Phase | Features |
|-------|----------|
| **MVP** | Made for You, Rare Find, This Reminded Me |
| **Post-MVP** | Monthly Wrapped, Listener Profile/Archetypes |
| **Later** | Profile Match, Hot Right Now, Year in Listening |

## Bonus: The Token Economy Network Effect

### The Core Insight

Network effect isn't just social - it's **economic**. More users = more generated content = your tokens go further.

### The Gold Mine Problem (And Solution)

**Problem:** If all content is shared, eventually library is "complete" and no one pays.

**Solution:** Library isn't CONTENT - it's **CONTENT × VOICE**

| Content | Voice A | Voice B | Voice C | Your Clone |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------|
| Article 1 | Generated | - | - | - |
| Article 2 | - | Generated | - | - |

Same article, different voice = different product = infinite library

### The Hybrid Model (Model C)

| Content Type | Token Cost | Why |
|--------------|------------|-----|
| **Popular (500+ listens)** | FREE | Network effect hook |
| **Friend's content** | FREE | Social incentive |
| **New/niche content** | 1 token | Pioneer pays |
| **Reprocess in your voice** | 1 token | Personalization |
| **Premium voices** | 2 tokens | Best quality |
| **Your cloned voice** | Premium sub | Ultimate personalization, never shared |

### The "Reprocess" Feature

```
Friend shares article → Voice A (free to listen)
You prefer Voice B → [Reprocess in my voice] → 1 token
Now in YOUR library, YOUR voice
```

### Why This Works

| Layer | Network Effect | Revenue |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Content discovery** | More users = bigger shared pool | FREE (hook) |
| **Voice preference** | Pool exists, not in YOUR voice | TOKEN (monetize) |
| **Voice clone** | Personal, never shared | PREMIUM (moat) |

### The Virtuous Cycle

```
More users
    → More content in shared pool
        → Better discovery for everyone (network effect)
            → But you want YOUR voice (revenue)
                → Sustainable business model
```

### Revenue Protection

| Defense | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Voice is personal** | Same content, different voice = new generation |
| **Voice tech improves** | New voices → old generations feel outdated |
| **Clone is premium** | Your voice = never in shared pool |
| **Mood collections** | "Deep Focus" vs "Energetic Commute" = different voices |

### The Formula

> **Network effect DRIVES discovery. Voice preference DRIVES revenue.**

## Future: Attribution & Referral System

*Not MVP - implement when revenue allows rewarding referrers*

### URL Attribution (Free - MVP Ready)

```
https://tsucast.app/listen/[article-id]
  ?ref=made_for_you        # which viral feature
  &from=user_123           # who shared
  &voice=calm_british      # which voice
  &ts=1706000000           # timestamp
```

Track at no cost: source, referrer, content, voice, device, signup delay.

### Public Attribution (Free - MVP Ready)

| Location | Display |
|----------|---------|
| Shared article | "Tino shared this with you" |
| Player | Small "via Tino" under title |
| Discovery | "From Tino's library" tag |
| Popular content | "First shared by Tino" |

### Referral Rewards (Post-Revenue)

**Mutual Benefit Model:**
- You share → Friend signs up → BOTH get 2 bonus tokens

**Milestones:**
| Level | Reward |
|-------|--------|
| 5 referrals | "Connector" badge |
| 15 referrals | Premium voice trial (1 week) |
| 50 referrals | "Ambassador" status + perks |

### Attribution Dashboard (Post-Revenue)

```
Acquisition Sources
├── Made for You:    45%
├── Rare Find:       20%
├── Wrapped:         15%
├── Organic:         12%

Top Referrers
├── @marie: 34 signups
├── @tino:  28 signups

Best Converting Content
├── "How to Do Great Work" → 156 signups
```

### MVP vs Later

| Feature | MVP? | Cost |
|---------|------|------|
| URL params tracking | YES | Free |
| Server-side logging | YES | Free |
| Public "shared by" | YES | Free |
| Referral rewards (tokens) | NO | Costs tokens |
| Milestone badges | NO | Build time |
| Dashboard | NO | Build time |

## Unit Economics: Fish Audio Pricing

### API Pricing (Pay-as-you-go)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **TTS Cost** | $15.00 per 1 million UTF-8 bytes |
| **Reference** | 1M bytes ≈ 180,000 words ≈ 12 hours audio |
| **Per hour** | ~$1.25 |
| **Models** | speech-1.5, speech-1.6, s1 (same price) |

### Cost Per Article

| Article Size | Words | Bytes | Fish Audio Cost |
|--------------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Short (newsletter) | 1,500 | 9K | $0.14 |
| Medium (blog post) | 3,000 | 18K | $0.27 |
| Long (essay) | 5,000 | 30K | $0.45 |
| Very long (paper) | 10,000 | 60K | $0.90 |

### Rate Limits

| Tier | Spending Threshold | Concurrent Requests |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Starter | < $100 | 5 |
| Elevated | ≥ $100 | 15 |
| Enterprise | Custom | Custom |

### Subscription Pricing Model

| Plan | Price | Articles | Cost/Article | Margin |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Free | $0 | 3/day | - | Marketing |
| Basic | $5/mo | 15 | $0.33 | ~27% |
| Pro | $12/mo | 50 | $0.24 | ~47% |
| Unlimited | $25/mo | 150 | $0.17 | ~62% |

### Safety Rules

1. **Know cost before generate:** `cost = bytes × ($15 / 1M)`
2. **Cap article length:** Free tier max 5K words, Paid max 15K
3. **Deduct tokens BEFORE generation:** Never post-pay
4. **Monitor margins:** Flag users with negative unit economics

### The Formula

```
Token price > (Fish Audio cost + storage + bandwidth) × 1.3

For average 5K word article:
Token price > ($0.45 + $0.01 + $0.01) × 1.3 = $0.61 minimum
```

Safe token value: **$0.75 - $1.00 per long article**

## Retention: NDR, Churn & Magic Moment

### Usage Frequency Benchmarks

| User Type | Sessions/Week | Articles/Week |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Casual | 1-2 | 2-3 |
| Regular | 3-4 | 5-8 |
| Power user | 5-7 | 10+ |

**Good customer benchmark:** 3+ sessions/week, 5+ articles/week

**Usage triggers:** Morning walk, commute, gym, cooking, falling asleep

### The Magic Moment

**Hypothesis:** "3 completed articles in first 7 days"

Why this predicts retention:
- Understood the product (1 isn't enough)
- Came back (not one-and-done)
- Found use case (3 things worth listening to)

**Alternative candidates to test:**

| Behavior | Metric |
|----------|--------|
| First full listen | Completed 1 article (>80%) |
| Second session | Returned within 48 hours |
| Library building | 3+ articles saved |
| Long session | Single session > 30 min |
| Share action | Shared 1 article |

### Why Users Churn

| Reason | Signal | Prevention |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Never got value | 0-1 listens | Better onboarding |
| Forgot about it | Declining usage | Notifications, habit triggers |
| Hit limit, didn't convert | Free user left | Smooth upgrade UX |
| Found alternative | Sudden stop | Be the best |
| Too expensive | Cancel at renewal | Price/value alignment |

### Reduce Churn Tactics

| Tactic | How |
|--------|-----|
| Value reminder at renewal | "You listened to 12 hours this month" |
| Win-back flows | "We miss you + 5 free articles" |
| Cancellation survey | Ask why, offer pause instead |
| Annual plans | Discount for commitment |
| Pause option | Don't cancel, just pause |

### Increase NDR (Expansion)

| Tactic | How |
|--------|-----|
| Usage-based nudges | "14/15 articles used. Upgrade?" |
| Feature gating | Premium voices, offline, longer articles |
| Natural limit hits | Upgrade prompt at ceiling |
| Value demonstration | "Pro users listen 3x more" |

### Events to Instrument

```
article_started    → user, article, timestamp, source
article_completed  → user, article, % listened, duration
session_started    → user, timestamp
session_ended      → duration, articles_count
share_action       → user, article, channel
limit_hit          → user, plan, timestamp
upgrade            → user, from_plan, to_plan
churn              → user, plan, last_active, reason
```

### Finding Magic Moment (Post-Launch)

1. **Instrument everything** from day 1
2. **Cohort analysis** at ~1000 users
3. **Compare retained vs churned** - what did retained users do in week 1?
4. **Find the gap** - retained users avg X, churned avg Y
5. **Optimize onboarding** to push users toward magic moment

### The Formula

```
NDR = (Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting MRR

Goal: NDR > 100%
```

### Retention Checklist

- [ ] Instrument all key events from launch
- [ ] Track "value delivered" vs price paid
- [ ] Build value reminder at renewal time
- [ ] Create win-back email flow
- [ ] Offer pause instead of cancel
- [ ] Run cohort analysis at 1000 users
- [ ] Identify and optimize for magic moment
